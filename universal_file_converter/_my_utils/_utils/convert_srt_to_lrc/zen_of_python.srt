00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Beautiful is better than ugly.
3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Explicit is better than implicit.
4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Simple is better than complex.
5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Complex is better than complicated.
6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Flat is better than nested.
7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sparse is better than dense.
8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Readability counts.
9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Although practicality beats purity.
11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Errors should never pass silently.
12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Unless explicitly silenced.
13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now is better than never.
17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Although never is often better than *right* now.
18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
